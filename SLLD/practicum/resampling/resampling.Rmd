\subsection{Data}

Today we will simulate our dataset! :)


\section{Bootstrapping}

There are two different ways of obtaining and evaluating bootstrap estimates: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item non-parametric;
  \item parametric;
\end{enumerate}

\textit{- Goal:} we have a set of $n$ observations from which we are able to calculate a statistic of interest $\theta$, but we have no formula to estimate its standard error. The latter may be useful to construct confidence intervals as well (e.g. ordinary 2-tailed $95\%$).


\subsection{Non-parametric Bootstrapping}

\textit{- Why non-parametric?} We often cannot reasonably assume that our sample is drawn from a known frequency distribution, but we can assume that it adequately reflects the underlying population from which it was drawn.

\subsubsection{By hand}

We generate a sample from a binomial distribution with parameters $(15,0.71)$.
```{r}
set.seed(123)
x <- rbinom(n=30,       # sample size
            size=15,    # num. of trials
            prob=0.71)  # prob. of success per trial
x

n <- length(x)
n

summary(x)

```

Let's pretend that we do not know the true underlying distribution. 

Our goal is to estimate the 90th percentile, and we rely on \textbf{non-parametric bootstrapping}.
```{r}

help(sample)

set.seed(123)

# number of bootstrap samples
B <- 2000 

# initialize an empty "container" for each of these
bootstrapsample <- matrix(NA, 
                         nrow = n, 
                         ncol = B)
dim(bootstrapsample)
bootstrapsample[1:3, 1:3]

for(i in 1:B){
  # assign (column-wise) B draws with replacement
  bootstrapsample[, i] <- sample(x,n,replace=TRUE)
}

summary(bootstrapsample[, 1:3])

```

Now we can compute our statistic of interest on each of these 2000 samples -- producing $B$ bootstrap values. 

In our case, the statistic we are interested in is the 90th percentile.
```{r}

# to apply some function column-wise
help(apply)
# function of interest
help(quantile)

B_values <- apply(bootstrapsample,   # data
                  2,                 # dimension (i.e. column-wise)
                  quantile,          # function to apply
                  probs=0.9)          # input for the function
head(B_values)
```

So we have the following point estimate and its standard error:
```{r}

results <- data.frame("mean" = mean(B_values), 
                      "SD" = sd(B_values))
rownames(results) <- "Manual"

results

```

\subsubsection{Using the boot package}

We can automatically perform non-parametric bootstrapping using the \textbf{boot} package. 
The main bootstrapping function is boot() and has the following syntax:
```{r}
help(boot)
```

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{data:} The data as a vector, matrix or data frame. If it is a matrix or data frame then each row is considered as one multivariate observation;
  \item \textbf{statistic:} A function which when applied to data returns a vector containing the statistic(s) of interest. [...] The first argument passed will always be the original data. The second will be a vector of indices, frequencies or weights which define the bootstrap sample;
  \item \textbf{R:}	The number of bootstrap replicates;
\end{enumerate}

\textit{Remark:} it is mandatory to pass a"user-defined function" in the field \textbf{statistic}. 

In the case of the 90th percentile, our estimation function is:
```{r}
# x: vector
# d: set of indexes
# prob: quantile
sampleperc <- function(x, d, prob=0.9) {
  return(quantile(x[d], probs=prob))
}
```

The estimation function (that we wrote on top, and has to be so) comprises data $x$ and a vector of indexes $d$. 
This function will be called many times, one for each bootstrap replication. 
Every time, the data $x$ will be the same, and only the bootstrap sample indexed by $d$ will change.

Once we have written a function like this, here is how we obtain bootstrap estimates of the standard error for the 90th percentile of the distribution:
```{r}

set.seed(123)

b = boot(x, sampleperc, R=2000)
print(b)

# notice how close this is to our previous computation
results <- rbind.data.frame(results, 
                            data.frame("mean" = b$t0,   # mean(b$t)
                                       "SD" = sd(b$t))) # for some reason you must compute it again
rownames(results)[2] <- "boot"
results

# bias calculation
mean(b$t)-b$t0


```

It is also easy to get a confidence interval (but be careful) using the function \textbf{boot.ci} that requires an object of class "boot" (i.e. computed using \textbf{boot}). 

This function generates (by default) 5 different types of equi-tailed two-sided nonparametric confidence intervals. 
These are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item first order normal approximation;
  \item basic bootstrap interval
  \item studentized bootstrap interval (bootstrap variance needed)
  \item bootstrap percentile interval
  \item adjusted bootstrap percentile (BCa) interval. 
\end{itemize}

```{r}
help(boot.ci)
boot.ci(b, conf=0.95)
```

\subsection{Parametric Bootstrapping}

\textit{- Why parametric?} It is very useful when we can reasonably assume that our sample follows a known distribution.

\subsubsection{By hand}
We have a sample of size $n=30$ from a binomial distribution with parameters $(N=15, p=0.71)$.
```{r}
set.seed(123)

n = 30
N <- 15
x <- rbinom(n = n, size = N, prob = 0.71)
x

```

Let's assume that we know the underlying distribution, where the actual parameter $p$ is unknown, and we want to estimate the 90th percentile as before. 

Based on MLE: ($\hat{p}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i}{nN}$)
```{r}

p_hat <- mean(x)/N
p_hat

```

We use parametric bootstrap and compute $B$ samples of size  $n$ from the known distribution.
```{r}

B <- 2000       # number of bootstrap samples
tempdata <- rbinom(B*n, 
                   size = N, 
                   prob = p_hat)

bootstrapsample <- matrix(tempdata, nrow = n, ncol = B)
dim(bootstrapsample)
bootstrapsample[, 1:5]


```

Now we can compute the statistic of interest on each of these 2000 samples -- producing $B$ bootstrap values. 

In our case, we are interested in the 90th percentile.
```{r}
B_values <- apply(bootstrapsample, 2, quantile, prob=0.9)
head(B_values)
summary(B_values)

```

So we have the following estimate and standard error:
```{r}

resultsParam <- data.frame("mean" = mean(B_values), 
                      "SD" = sd(B_values))
rownames(resultsParam) <- "Manual_Parametric"
resultsParam

```


Let's compare it with the \textbf{boot} function:
```{r}

set.seed(123)

B = 2000

p.rg <- function(data, mle, N=15) {
    out <- rbinom(length(data), 
                     size = N, 
                     prob = mle)
    out
}


bBoot <- boot(x, sampleperc, R = B, sim = "parametric",
                 ran.gen = p.rg, mle = (mean(x)/N))
bBoot


# notice how close this is to our previous computation
resultsParam <- rbind.data.frame(resultsParam, 
                            data.frame("mean" = bBoot$t0,   # mean(b$t)
                                       "SD" = sd(bBoot$t))) # for some reason you must compute it again
rownames(resultsParam)[2] <- "boot_Parametric"
resultsParam

```


\section{Permutation Test}

Permutation tests are particularly relevant in experimental studies, where we are often interested in the sharp null hypothesis of no difference between treatment groups.

Let's generate a dataset divided into treatment (1) and control group (0).
```{r}

# they habe a difference in mean equal to 1
set.seed(1)
n <- 100
tr <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5) 
y <- 1 + tr + rnorm(n, 0, 3)

```

Let us compute the difference in mean between the two groups.
The difference in means is, as we would expect (since we made it up), about 1:
```{r}

means <- by(y, tr, mean)
diff0 <- diff(means)
diff0

```

To obtain a single permutation of the data, we simply resample without replacement and calculate the difference again:
```{r}
s <- sample(tr, length(tr), FALSE)  # shuffle the labels
by(y, s, mean)                      # compute mean in vector y according to class s

diff(by(y, s, mean))                # difference between 2 means
```

If we repeat this process a large number of times, we can build our approximate permutation distribution (i.e., the sampling distribution for the mean-difference). 

We'll use \textbf{replicate} to repeat our permutation process. The result will be a vector of the differences from each permutation (i.e., our distribution):
```{r}
set.seed(123)

nperm = 2000
# nperm = 200  # try this too :)
# nperm = 5000
dist <- replicate(nperm, diff(by(y, sample(tr, length(tr), FALSE), mean)))
head(dist)

```
 
We can look at our distribution using an histogram indicating with a vertical line the observed difference:
```{r}
hist(dist, xlim = c(-3, 3), col = "grey", breaks = 100)
abline(v = diff(by(y, tr, mean)), col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```

Now, we can use the distribution to obtain a $p$-value for our mean-difference by counting how many permuted mean-differences are larger than the one we observed in our actual data. We can then divide this by the number of items in our permutation distribution (i.e., nperm=2000 from our call to replicate, above):
```{r}
sum(dist > diff0)/nperm             # one-tailed test
sum(abs(dist) > abs(diff0))/nperm   # two-tailed test
```

\subsection{Permutation Test with coin}

Even if we implemented our own permutation distributions, R provides a package to conduct permutation tests called \textbf{coin}. 
We can compare our result from above with the result from \textbf{coin}:
```{r}
# library(coin)
independence_test(y ~ tr, alternative = "greater")  # one-tailed
independence_test(y ~ tr)                           # two-tailed (default)
```

Almost anything that you can address in a parametric framework can also be done in a permutation framework otherwise you can create your own permutation test!
