# Statement

Given the integer N - the number of minutes that is passed since midnight - how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock?

The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59).

For example, if N = 150, then 150 minutes have passed since midnight - i.e. now is 2:30 am. So the program should print `2 30`.


# Example input

```
150
```

# Example output

```
2 30
```
