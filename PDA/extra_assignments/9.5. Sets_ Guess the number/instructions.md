# Statement

Augustus and Beatrice play the following game. Augustus thinks of a secret integer number from 1 to **n**. Beatrice tries to guess the number by providing a set of integers. Augustus answers `YES` if his secret number exists in the provided set, or `NO`, if his number does not exist in the provided set. Then after a few questions Beatrice, totally confused, asks you to help her determine Augustus's secret number.

Given the positive integer **n** in the first line, followed by the a sequence Beatrice's guesses, series of numbers seperated by spaces and Agustus's responses, or Beatrice's plea for `HELP`. When Beatrice calls for help, provide a list of all the remaining possible secret numbers, in ascending order, separated by a space.

# Example input

```
10
1 2 3 4 5
YES
2 4 6 8 10

# Example output
