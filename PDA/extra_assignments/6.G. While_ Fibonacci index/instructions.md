Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the integer sequence starting with 1, 1 where every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:


1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...


Given a positive integer, determine if it's the **n**th Fibonacci number for some **n**. If it is, print such **n**, otherwise print **-1**.
