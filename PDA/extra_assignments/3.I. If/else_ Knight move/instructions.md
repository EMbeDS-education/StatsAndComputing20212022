# Statement

Chess knight can move to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. The complete move therefore looks like the letter _L_. Given two different squares of the chessboard, determine whether a knight can go from the first square to the second one in a single move.

The program receives four numbers from 1 to 8 each specifying the column and the row number, first two - for the first square, and the last two - for the second square. The program should output YES if a knight can go from the first square to the second one in a single move or NO otherwise.


 

# Example input
