# Statement

Write a program that greets the user by printing the word "Hello", a comma, the name of the user and an exclamation mark after it. See the examples below.

**Warning.** Your program's output should strictly match the desired one, character by character. There shouldn't be any space between the name and the exclamation mark. You can use `+` operator to concatenate two strings. See the lesson for details.
