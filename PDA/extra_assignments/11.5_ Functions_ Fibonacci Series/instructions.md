Write a function called "fib" that takes in a integer argument "n".  It should return a list of the numbers of the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary ("n")

Fibonacci series

Each number in the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. So, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. The mathematical equation describing it is Xn+2= Xn+1 + Xn

 Expected output:

```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
```
