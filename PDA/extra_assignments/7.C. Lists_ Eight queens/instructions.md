# Statement

It is possible to place 8 queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, it requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.  

Given a placement of 8 queens on the chessboard. If there is a pair of queens that violates this rule, print `YES`, otherwise print `NO`. The input consists of eight coordinate pairs, one pair per line, with each pair giving the position of a queen on a standard chessboard with rows and columns numbered from 1 to 8.
