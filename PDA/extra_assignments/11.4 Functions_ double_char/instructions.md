Write a function called "double_char" that takes in a string argument.  It should return a string composed of two of each character in the original string.  It might be a little confusing - look at examples below:

```
double_char("Hello") returns "HHeelllloo"
```

```
double_char("?33? sw") returns "??3333??  ssww"
```
