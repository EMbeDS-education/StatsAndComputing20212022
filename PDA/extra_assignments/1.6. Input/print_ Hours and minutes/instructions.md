# Statement

Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?


The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).


For example, if N = 3900, then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight - i.e. now it's 1:05am. So the program should print **1 65** - 1 full hour is passed since midnight, 65 full minutes passed since midnight.  

# Example input

```
3900
```

# Example output

```
1 65
```
